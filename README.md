# 👋 Hey there! I’m Juuso!

I’m a **C# developer and Blazor enthusiast** who loves turning ideas into interactive experiences.  
With a background in **public employment and residential services**, I bring a unique mix of **technical precision** and **real-world problem-solving** to every project I work on.

* **Currently exploring** new ways to blend *software design*, *software development*, and *human-centered thinking.*
* **Focus areas:** C#, .NET Core/Blazor, and interactive systems.  
* **Driven by:** curiosity, collaboration, and creating tools or experiences that make life a bit easier — or more fun.
