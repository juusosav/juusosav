With a background in **public employment and residential services**, I bring a unique mix of **technical precision** and **real-world problem-solving** to every project I work on.

💡 **Currently exploring** new ways to blend *game design*, *software development*, and *human-centered thinking.*  
🛠️ **Focus areas:** C#, Unity, gameplay mechanics, and interactive systems.  
🌍 **Driven by:** curiosity, collaboration, and creating tools or experiences that make life a bit easier — or more fun.
